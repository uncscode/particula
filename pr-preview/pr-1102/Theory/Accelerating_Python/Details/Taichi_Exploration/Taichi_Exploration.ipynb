    "#### Why Use the Minimum Time & FLOPs-Based Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "When benchmarking numerical code on a modern, multitasking OS, your process competes with background tasks—OS services, antivirus scans, indexing, other applications, etc.—so the **mean** execution time often fluctuates wildly. The **minimum** observed time per call, however, reflects the best-case scenario with minimal interference. This makes it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More Stable:** Outliers from context switches or cache misses are discarded.  \n",
    "- **Reproducible:** You get a consistent baseline, regardless of transient system load.  \n",
    "- **Optimistic Bound:** It approximates the true cost of your code under ideal conditions—perfect for comparing implementations or optimizations.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tying Minimum Time to FLOPs per Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "A **FLOP** (floating-point operation) is any arithmetic operation on floating-point numbers (e.g., add, multiply). By counting how many FLOPs your kernel performs per call and dividing by the **minimum** time, you obtain the **FLOPs per cycle** metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FLOPs per cycle = Total FLOPs per call ÷ (min_time_s × CPU_Hz)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU cycles per call = min_time_s × CPU_Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why use min_time_s?**  \n",
    "  Using the **minimum** time ensures your FLOPs-per-cycle estimate isn’t skewed by background noise. Any spikes in call duration (due to other processes) would artificially lower your measured throughput; the minimum time filters these out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it tells you:**  \n",
    "  - **High FLOPs per cycle** means you’re effectively leveraging vector units and instruction-level parallelism.  \n",
    "  - A stable FLOPs-per-cycle number lets you track real improvements as you optimize memory access patterns, data layout, or parallelism—free from jitter introduced by OS scheduling.\n",

    "1. **Why Minimum Time Matters**  \n",
    "   The **min time** filters out occasional spikes from OS context switches or cache cold-starts, giving a clearer view of true kernel performance under ideal conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Throughput vs. Variability**  \n",
    "   - A steady **throughput** of ~2.5 k calls/s shows the kernel is performant overall.  \n",
    "   - However, a **std dev** exceeding the mean latency indicates significant jitter. Consider discarding the first few “warm-up” calls or running on an isolated CPU core to reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Efficiency**  \n",
    "   At ~2 FLOPs per cycle, the implementation uses vector units but isn’t yet saturating them. Potential optimizations include:\n",
    "   - **Explicit vectorization** (e.g., ensure loops map cleanly to AVX lanes).  \n",
    "   - **Data layout tuning** to improve memory access patterns and cache usage.  \n",
    "   - **GPU offload** (Taichi supports CUDA backends), which may boost performance if memory bandwidth and parallelism become limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis suggests the Taichi implementation delivers strong raw performance but leaves room for both consistency improvements and higher utilization of the hardware’s vector capabilities."

    "## Taichi Acceleration: Analysis & Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook benchmarks a core **coagulation gain‐rate** kernel implemented both in **Taichi** and in **pure Python**, sweeping the number of size bins. For each configuration, it measures:\n",
    "- **Execution Time** via `perf_counter_ns` (min/mean/std)  \n",
    "- **Throughput** (calls/sec)  \n",
    "- **CPU Cycles per Call**  \n",
    "- **Estimated FLOP per Call**\n",
    "- **Efficiency** (FLOP per CPU cycle)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Scalability & Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Taichi Efficiency** rises steeply with increasing bin count, then plateaus around 20 FLOPs/cycle for large problems.  \n",
    "- **Python Efficiency** gradually declines as problem size grows.  \n",
    "- **Speedup Ratio** (Taichi:Python) increases from a few hundred at small bin counts to **≈1,000×** at 1,000 bins—demonstrating better amortization of Taichi’s kernel-launch overhead on larger workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector & Parallel Utilization**  \n",
    "   Taichi effectively maps the double‐loop integration onto SIMD lanes (and potentially multithreading), yielding several FLOPs per cycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overhead Amortization**  \n",
    "   For very small problems, Taichi’s kernel‐launch and data‐transfer costs limit speedup. As the workload grows, these overheads become negligible, showcasing Taichi’s true compute advantages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pure-Python Limitations**  \n",
    "   The Python implementation suffers from function‐call overhead, lack of parallelism, and no direct access to hardware vector units—resulting in orders-of-magnitude lower throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusions & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Taichi provides dramatic acceleration** for compute-bound kernels once problem sizes exceed the launch‐overhead threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes a strong case for using an accelerated backend like Taichi for performance-critical applications in particula simulation package. Other backend options, should be explored before fully committing to one over another."
