    "This Jupyter notebook is designed to deepen your understanding of mixing behaviors in solutions, focusing on both theoretical models and practical applications. We will explore ideal and non-ideal mixing rules, differentiate between mass-based and molar-based approaches, and introduce the kappa value parameterization for predicting water activity.\n",

    "## Introduction to Mixing Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixing rules are essential for predicting the properties of solutions, including their thermodynamic behavior and phase equilibria. In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define and compare different mixing rules:** Understand how various rules apply to different types of solutions.\n",
    "- **Mass-Based vs. Molar-Based Mixing:** Discuss the implications of choosing mass-based or molar-based calculations for different applications.\n",
    "- **Kappa Value based Activity:** Learn about the kappa value parameterization and its role in modeling water activity in non-ideal solutions.\n",
