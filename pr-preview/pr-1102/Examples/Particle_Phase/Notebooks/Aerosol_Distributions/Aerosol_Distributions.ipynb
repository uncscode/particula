    "In this section, we explore modeling a distribution with a single mode, typical for scenarios where particle populations are relatively uniform. The single mode represents a common characteristic size (mode) and spread (geometric standard deviation) of aerosol particles. We utilize parameters for the geometric standard deviation and the modal particle diameter to define this distribution. The distribution is scaled such that the area under the probability density function (PDF) equals the total number of particles, ensuring that it accurately reflects the particle count in terms of probability across different sizes. This method is particularly useful for representing aerosol populations where a single predominant size class exists, making it easier to analyze and predict aerosol behavior in environmental or laboratory settings."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored two fundamental representations of aerosol size distributions: the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the Particle Mass Function (PMF). Both offer valuable insights into aerosol characteristics but serve different analytical purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: The PDF provides a normalized view of particle size distribution where the area under the curve represents the total number of particles. It is ideal for understanding the relative frequency of different particle sizes within a continuous range and for conducting probability-based analyses. The PDF is particularly useful in theoretical studies and simulations where understanding the likelihood of particle sizes is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Particle Mass Function (PMF)**: Conversely, the PMF directly quantifies the actual number of particles in each size interval. This discrete representation is especially useful for practical applications such as air quality monitoring and aerosol delivery systems where knowing the exact count of particles at different sizes is necessary. The PMF is straightforward as it adds up to the total particle count directly, providing a more tangible grasp of particle distribution without requiring integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods play critical roles in aerosol science, each complementing the other by offering different perspectives on particle size distributions. Understanding when to use each can significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of aerosol studies."
