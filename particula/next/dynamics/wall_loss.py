    Calculate the wall loss rate of particles in a spherical chamber.

    This function computes the rate at which particles are lost to the walls
    of a spherical chamber, based on the system state. It uses the wall eddy
    diffusivity, particle properties (radius, density, concentration), and
    environmental conditions (temperature, pressure) to determine the loss
    rate.

    Arguments:
        wall_eddy_diffusivity: The rate of wall eddy diffusivity in inverse
            seconds (s⁻¹).
        particle_radius: The radius of the particle in meters (m).
        particle_density: The density of the particle in kilograms per cubic
            meter (kg/m³).
        particle_concentration: The concentration of particles in the chamber
            in particles per cubic meter (#/m³).

        pressure: The pressure of the system in Pascals (Pa).
