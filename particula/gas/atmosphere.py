class Atmosphere:

    Represents a mixture of gas species under specific conditions.

    This class represents the atmospheric environment by detailing properties
    such as temperature and pressure, alongside a dynamic list of gas species
    present.

    Attributes:
        - temperature : Temperature of the gas mixture in Kelvin.
        - total_pressure : Total atmospheric pressure of the mixture in
          Pascals.
        - partitioning_species : List of GasSpecies objects representing the
          various species within the gas mixture, that can be
          partitioned to the particle phase.
        - gas_only_species : List of GasSpecies objects representing the
          various species within the gas mixture, that cannot be
          partitioned to the particle phase.

    Methods:
    - add_partitioning_species : Adds a GasSpecies object to the mixture.
    - add_gas_only_species : Adds a GasSpecies object to the mixture.
