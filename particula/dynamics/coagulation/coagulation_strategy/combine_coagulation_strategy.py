    Combine multiple coagulation strategies into one.

    This class takes a list of coagulation strategies and merges their
    kernels by summing them. Each included strategy must share the same
    distribution type.

    Attributes:
        - distribution_type : Matches the distribution_type of the first
          strategy.
        - strategies : A list of individual CoagulationStrategyABC instances.

    Methods:
    - dimensionless_kernel : Raises NotImplementedError, as not supported here.
    - kernel : Compute the sum of all strategy kernels.
    - loss_rate : Calculate the coagulation loss rate.
    - gain_rate : Calculate the coagulation gain rate.
    - net_rate : Get the net coagulation rate (gain - loss).
    - step : Perform a single step of coagulation.
    - diffusive_knudsen : Calculate the diffusive Knudsen number.
    - coulomb_potential_ratio : Compute Coulomb potential ratio.
    - friction_factor : Compute the effective friction factor.
