Combine Coagulation Strategy Builder Module

Provides a builder for creating `CombineCoagulationStrategy` objects,
which can merge multiple sub-strategies (e.g., Brownian, Turbulent)
into a single, combined coagulation approach. This allows flexible,
modular composition of different coagulation mechanisms.

Creates a combined coagulation strategy from multiple sub-strategies.

This builder follows standard usage:
    builder.set_strategies([...]).build()

    Builder for a combined coagulation strategy.

    This class constructs a `CombineCoagulationStrategy` from multiple
    sub-strategies (instances of `CoagulationStrategyABC`), enabling
    advanced modeling scenarios where different coagulation mechanisms
    act concurrently. Each sub-strategy's rate calculations are effectively
    merged to act on the same particle population.

    Attributes:
        - strategies : List of `CoagulationStrategyABC` objects to combine.

    Methods:
    - set_strategies : Set the list of coagulation strategies to combine.
    - build : Create and return the combined coagulation strategy.

    Examples:
        ```py title="Combine Coagulation Strategy Example"
        import particula as par
        builder = par.dynamics.CombineCoagulationStrategyBuilder()
        builder.set_strategies([brownian_strategy, turbulent_strategy])
