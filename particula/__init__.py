"""a simple, fast, and powerful particle simulator.

particula is a simple, fast, and powerful particle simulator, or at
least two of the three, we hope. It is a simple particle system that
is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. The goal is to have
a robust aerosol (gas phase and particle phase) simulation system that
can be used to answer scientific questions that arise for experiments
and research discussions.
