    """
    Function to estimate the density of organic compounds based on the simple
    model by Girolami (1994). The input parameters include molar mass, O:C
    and H:C ratios. If the H:C ratio is unknown at input, enter a negative
    value. The actual H:C will then be estimated based on an initial assumption
    of H:C = 2. The model also estimates the number of carbon atoms per
    molecular structure based on molar mass, O:C, and H:C.
    The density is then approximated by the formula of Girolami.

    Args:
        molar_mass(float): Molar mass.
        oxygen2carbon (float): O:C ratio.
        hydrogen2carbon (float): H:C ratio. If unknown, provide a negative

        nitrogen2carbon (float, optional): N:C ratio. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
