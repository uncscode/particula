# Contributor Guidelines

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to this project!
While we have specific guidelines below, _we also encourage you to
contribute to the best of your ability and not let these guidelines
hinder your productivity and creativity_. We are open to any contribution,
and we are always looking for new ways to improve the project.
We are also open to any feedback, however small or large,
and in any area (from documentation to calculation to presentation).


Follow this workflow to contribute:

1. **Sync with upstream (optional):** If you want to ensure your fork is up to date with the main repository, add the upstream remote and pull latest changes:  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/uncscode/particula.git
   git pull upstream main
   ```  
   This step is especially important if your fork is older. Skip if you just forked and nothing has changed upstream.
2. **Create a new branch:** Before making your changes, create a feature branch to isolate your work. For example:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue123-fix-simulation
   ```  
   Choose a descriptive branch name. If your contribution addresses a specific GitHub issue, include its number (e.g., `issue123...` as shown).
3. **Make your changes:** Open the project in VS Code (you can run `code .` in the project folder to launch it). Implement your feature or bugfix by editing the relevant files. Save your changes.
4. **Run tests (optional but recommended):** If the project has tests, run them to ensure your changes donâ€™t break anything. For example, Particula might use pytest:  
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```  
   Ensure all tests pass before committing.
5. **Commit your changes:** Stage your modified files and commit with a clear message:  
   ```bash
   git add . 
   git commit -m "Fix simulation time-step logic (Issue #123)"
   ```  
   Write a concise commit message that describes **what** you changed and **why**.
6. **Push the branch to your fork:**  
   ```bash
   git push -u origin issue123-fix-simulation
   ```  
   The `-u origin <branch>` sets the upstream tracking, so future pushes can be done with just `git push`.
7. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to your fork on GitHub. Youâ€™ll see a prompt to compare & open a pull request for the branch you just pushed. Click that, add a descriptive title and commentary about your changes (mention which issue it fixes, if any), and submit the PR to the upstream repository (the `uncscode/particula` repoâ€™s main branch).
8. **Respond to feedback:** Maintainers will review your PR. Be prepared to answer questions or make adjustments if requested. Discuss any test failures or requested changes, and push new commits to the same branch; the PR will update automatically.

Congratulations on submitting a contribution! ðŸŽ‰ Once your pull request is approved and merged, your changes will become part of Particula. Donâ€™t forget to follow our [Code of Conduct](contribute/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting in the community. For more detailed guidelines on contributing (coding style, commit conventions, etc.), see the full [Contributor Guidelines](contribute/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the documentation.

The cycle of contribution goes something like this:

1. See if there is an issue open that you can help with.
If there is not one, please open one.

2. Create a personal fork of this repository;
and in it, create a branch (from `uncscode:main`)
with the `issue000` in the name of the branch
(e.g. `username/issue000` or `issue000`),
where `000` is the number of the issue from step 1.

3. Set up an appropriate environment:
    - an easy option is just to use the `.devcontainer` in root
    - another option is to either `pip install` or `conda install`
    the packages required for development in `requirements.txt` in root.

4. Write your code in the branch. This usually includes the following.

    a. Code to be implemented.

    b. Documentation associated with added code in a.

    c. Tests associated with added code in a.

    d. Ideally, you'd also add a Jupyter notebook to
    showcase your work (if applicable).

5. _Optionally_, you can run standard linting and testing calls
on your code _locally_ to make sure it works as expected.
This can be done in several ways,
for example the `pylint`, `flake8`, and `pytest` calls below.
These calls will be run once you submit your pull request.

6. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
Upon submission, standard automated tests will be run on your code.

7. If you don't hear back from maintainers,
feel free to mention one of us directly in the comments of the PR.
Expect to have speedy feedback and help from us to finalize the PR.

```bash
pylint $(find particula/ -name "*.py" | xargs)
```

```bash
flake8 particula/ --count
```

```bash
pytest particula/
```

We are excited and looking forward to your contribution!

## GitHub

We use GitHub to develop `particula` completely in the open. Our repository is available here: [https://uncscode.github.io/particula/](https://uncscode.github.io/particula/).
There are several ways to use GitHub: through the command line via `git` and/or `gh`, through the web interface and/or the GitHub web editor, or through an IDE like PyCharm or a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
In general, we recommend that you fork our repository, that you work with VS Code, and that submit a pull request based on an issue.
If any of these sound unfamiliar or if you need help, please see more information below and feel free to contact us directly to discuss options.
We look forward to getting you started and up to speed on this project with us!

Links: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a free and open-source code editor for writing code and it has a rich ecosystem of extensions that allow you to write code in a variety of languages with a lot of helpful features and tools.

Links: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Python code style

We follow the Google's Python style guide.
We encourage you to follow it too, but we also encourage you to contribute to the best of your ability and not let these guidelines hinder your productivity and creativity.

## Running `particula` locally

Once you are in the root directory, you will be able to import `particula` as a package/model and thus all documentation on website applies.
You must be in the root directory.

## Writing tests

It is essential that every piece of code has an associated test.
This is a good way to ensure that the code is working as intended.
It also ensures that the code is not broken and that the code is not too complex.
However small or big, a test is always required.

## Running testing/linting locally

We use `pytest`, `pylint`, and `flake8` to run tests and linting.
The command below can be run in the root directory like you'd run the package above.

```bash
pylint $(find particula/ -name "*.py" | xargs)
```

```bash
flake8 particula/ --count
```

```bash
pytest particula/
```

## Building `particula` locally

To build `particula` locally, you must be in the root directory.
You have two options, depending on your usage case.

1. You can use `python -m build` to build the package wheels locally (note: you will need to install `build` too, via `pip install build`).
2. You can build the conda recipe available at [https://github.com/conda-forge/particula-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/particula-feedstock) either via `python build-locally.py` in the root of `particula-feedstock` or via `conda build recipe` (equivalently, but faster, `mamba build recipe`). For the latter, you will need to have `conda-build` installed (for `conda build` to work) or `boa` (for `mamba build` to work). In either case, you can install package with conda via, `conda install conda-build` or `mamba install boa`.

## Documentation writing

We prefer that the tutorials are written in the form of Jupyter notebooks after the package is released and published.
A convenient option is using Google's Colaboratory to write the notebooks.

We will update this regularly with more information, but in the meanwhile, please feel free to contact us directly on GitHub.
