# Theory

Particula's Theory section contains a collection of theoretical topics and concepts that are relevant to the Particula package. This includes mathematical equations, physical principles, and other scientific concepts that are used in the development and application of the Particula package.

In addition, we have discussions on implementation details, such as the use of OpenAI models and the integration of various tools and libraries. This section is designed to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and methodologies that drive the functionality of Particula.

See the sidebar on the left for a list of topic categories and their contents.
