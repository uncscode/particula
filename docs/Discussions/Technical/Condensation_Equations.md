# Condensation Discussion

Isothermal and non-isothermal condensation processes are fundamental in aerosol dynamics. Condensation involves the transfer of gas-phase species to the particle phase, which can be reversible when the species evaporates back into the gas phase. This process is pivotal in the formation of cloud droplets and the growth of atmospheric particles, influencing climate and air quality.

## Condensation Equations (Isothermal)

In the isothermal case, we consider condensation processes where the temperature remains constant, and the latent heat of vaporization is neglected. This approximation is valid when the heat released or absorbed during condensation or evaporation is insufficient to cause significant temperature changes.

This follows Chapter 2 (EQ 2.41) by Topping, D., & Bane, M. (2022). Introduction to Aerosol Modelling (D. Topping & M. Bane, Eds.). Wiley. https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119625728. Also Chapter 12 and 13 (EQ 13.3) of Seinfeld, J. H., & Pandis, S. N. (2016). Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change (3rd ed.). Wiley.

The isothermal condensation or evaporation process is defined by the following equation:

**Equation 1: Rate of Mass Change**

dmi/dt = N × k_cond × (pᵢ, gas − pᵢ, particle surface) × (molar massᵢ / (R × T))

**Where:**

- **dmi/dt**: Rate of change of mass of species **i** in the particle phase.
- **N**: Number of particles.
- **k_cond**: Per-particle first-order condensation coefficient.
- **pᵢ, gas**: Partial pressure of species **i** in the gas phase.
- **pᵢ, particle surface**: Partial pressure of species **i** at the particle surface, accounting for curvature and activity effects.
- **molar massᵢ**: Molar mass of species **i**.
- **R**: Ideal gas constant.
- **T**: Temperature.

**Description:**

This equation quantifies the net mass flux of species **i** from the gas phase to the particle phase (or vice versa) due to condensation or evaporation. The driving force is the difference in partial pressures (**pᵢ, gas − pᵢ, particle surface**), and it's scaled by the molar mass and thermodynamic constants to yield a mass rate.

### First-Order Condensation Coefficient

**Equation 2: Condensation Coefficient**

k_cond = 4 × π × radius_particle × Dᵢ × f(Kn, αᵢ)

**Where:**

- **radius_particle**: Radius of the particle.
- **Dᵢ**: Diffusion coefficient of species **i** in the gas phase.
- **f(Kn, αᵢ)**: Correction factor accounting for the transition between free-molecular and continuum regimes.
  - **Kn**: Knudsen number.
  - **αᵢ**: Mass accommodation coefficient.

**Description:**

The condensation coefficient **k_cond** represents the flux of molecules to the particle surface per unit concentration difference. It combines geometric factors with diffusion dynamics and corrections for different flow regimes.

### Correction Factor **f(Kn, αᵢ)**

**Equation 3: Correction Factor**

f = [0.75 × αᵢ × (1 + Kn)] / [Kn² + Kn + 0.283 × αᵢ × Kn + 0.75 × αᵢ]

**Where:**

- **αᵢ**: Mass accommodation coefficient for species **i**.
- **Kn**: Knudsen number.

**Knudsen Number:**

**Equation 4: Knudsen Number**

Kn = λᵢ / radius_particle

**Where:**

- **λᵢ**: Mean free path of gas molecules for species **i**.
- **radius_particle**: Particle radius.

**Description:**

The correction factor **f(Kn, αᵢ)** adjusts the condensation coefficient to account for the finite mean free path of gas molecules relative to the particle size. It ensures accurate depiction of mass transfer in both the free-molecular (high Kn) and continuum (low Kn) regimes.

## Condensation Equations (Latent Heat)

## Condensation Equations (Latent Heat)

When condensation results in significant heat release or absorption, the latent heat of vaporization must be considered. This scenario is critical in cloud droplet formation, where the heat effects can influence the condensation rate and local temperature.

**Equation 5: Rate of Mass Change with Latent Heat**

dm/dt = [N × 4 × π × radius_wet × Dᵢ × (pᵢ, gas − pᵢ, particle surface)] / { [ (Dᵢ × Lᵢ × pᵢ) / (κ × T) ] × [ (Lᵢ / (R × T)) − 1 ] + Rᵢ × T }

**Where:**

- **dm/dt**: Rate of change of mass of the droplet.
- **m**: Mass of the droplet.
- **radius_wet**: Wet radius of the droplet.
- **Dᵢ**: Diffusion coefficient of species **i**.
- **pᵢ, gas**: Partial pressure of species **i** in the gas phase.
- **pᵢ, particle surface**: Partial pressure at the particle surface.
- **Lᵢ**: Latent heat of vaporization for species **i**.
- **κ**: Thermal conductivity of air.
- **T**: Temperature.
- **Rᵢ**: Specific gas constant for species **i** (**R / molar massᵢ**).

**Description:**

This equation modifies the isothermal rate to include thermal effects due to latent heat. The denominator accounts for the additional resistance to mass transfer caused by the temperature gradient established from heat release or absorption during phase change.

### Partial Pressures

### Partial Pressures

Understanding the partial pressures in the gas phase and at the particle surface is essential for calculating the condensation rate.

**Gas Phase Partial Pressure:**

**Equation 6: Gas Phase Partial Pressure**

pᵢ, gas = concᵢ, gas × (R × T) / molar massᵢ

**Where:**

- **concᵢ, gas**: Concentration of species **i** in the gas phase.

**Description:**

This equation relates the concentration of a gas-phase species to its partial pressure using the ideal gas law, adjusted for the molar mass of the species.

**Particle Surface Partial Pressure:**

**Equation 7: Particle Surface Partial Pressure**

pᵢ, particle surface = pᵢ^pure × γᵢ × xᵢ × kᵢ, Kelvin

**Where:**

- **pᵢ^pure**: Saturation vapor pressure of pure species **i** (also denoted as **pᵢ^sat**, **pᵢ^vap**, or **pᵢ^0**).
- **γᵢ**: Activity coefficient of species **i** in the particle phase.
- **xᵢ**: Mole fraction of species **i** in the particle phase.
- **kᵢ, Kelvin**: Kelvin effect correction factor.

**Description:**

This equation adjusts the pure saturation vapor pressure to account for solution non-idealities (via **γᵢ** and **xᵢ**) and curvature effects (via **kᵢ, Kelvin**).

### Kelvin Effect Correction Factor

**Equation 8: Kelvin Effect**

kᵢ, Kelvin = exp( kᵢ, Kelvin radius / radius_particle )

**Where:**

- **kᵢ, Kelvin radius**: Kelvin radius factor.

**Equation 9: Kelvin Radius Factor**

kᵢ, Kelvin radius = [2 × σ_surface × molar massᵢ] / [ R × T × density ]

**Where:**

- **σ_surface**: Surface tension of the particle.
- **density**: Density of the particle.

**Description:**

The Kelvin effect expresses how vapor pressure over a curved surface differs from that over a flat surface. Small particles exhibit increased vapor pressure due to curvature, influencing condensation and evaporation rates.
### Additional Descriptive Text

**Understanding the Parameters:**

1. **Mass Accommodation Coefficient (αᵢ):**

   - Important for calculating the Knudsen number and determining the appropriate flow regime.

4. **Knudsen Number (Kn):**

   - Dimensionless number that characterizes the flow regime.
     - **Kn << 1**: Continuum regime; diffusion dominates.
     - **Kn >> 1**: Free-molecular regime; ballistic motion dominates.
   - Essential for selecting the correct correction factor **f(Kn, αᵢ)**.

5. **Latent Heat of Vaporization (Lᵢ):**

- **Air Quality Modeling:** Accurately modeling gas-particle partitioning helps in predicting pollutant behavior and secondary aerosol formation.

**Assumptions and Limitations:**

- **Isothermal Assumption:** In the isothermal equation, neglecting latent heat is valid only when temperature changes are negligible. For processes involving significant heat exchange, the non-isothermal equation should be used.
  
- **Spherical Particles:** The equations assume particles are spherical, which may not hold true for all aerosols (e.g., fractal soot particles).
  
- **Uniform Composition:** Assumes homogeneous particle composition. In reality, phase separation or gradients may exist within particles.

**Further Considerations:**

- **Multicomponent Systems:** In mixtures, interactions between different species can complicate calculations. Mutual diffusion coefficients and interactive effects need to be considered.
  
- **Dynamic Conditions:** Environmental factors like fluctuating temperature and pressure can affect condensation rates. Real-world applications may require time-dependent modeling.
  
- **Parameter Estimation:** Accurate values for parameters like **Dᵢ**, **αᵢ**, and **γᵢ** are necessary for precise predictions but can be challenging to obtain, especially for complex organic species.
