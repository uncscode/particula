# Prepared GPU simulations

Build a native CPU `Aerosol`, choose supported dynamics, and call `prepare()`
to upload its particle, gas and environment state once. The returned
`PreparedSimulation` owns a fixed GPU workspace. Repeated steps stay on that
device; `snapshot()` returns a detached CPU aerosol for analysis and plotting.
The initial aerosol remains unchanged.

The [complete quick start](../../examples/gpu/prepared/gpu_prepared_quick_start.py)
constructs all inputs and plots the resulting distributions. With an existing
native `aerosol` and configured `condensation` and `dilution` runnables:

```python
from particula import Backend

processes = condensation | dilution
with processes.prepare(
    aerosol, backend=Backend.WARP, device="cuda:0",
    time_step=1e-6, root_seed=42,
) as simulation:
    simulation.run(steps=1000)
    simulation.update_environment(temperature=283.15)
    simulation.capture()
    simulation.run(steps=2000)
    summary = simulation.diagnostics()
    checkpoint = simulation.checkpoint()
    result = simulation.snapshot()

with processes.resume(checkpoint) as continuation:
    continuation.run(steps=1000)
    later = continuation.snapshot()
```

This is explicit CUDA execution. Warp must be installed and the selected GPU
available; an unavailable target raises instead of substituting CPU execution.
`Backend.WARP` with `device="cpu"` is a separate regression path. Native NumPy
CPU execution continues to use the existing runnable execution methods.

## Supported process plans

Preparation validates exact supported classes and their configuration before
upload. Compose ordered subsets with `|`, with one occurrence of each family.
The order is scientifically meaningful. Supported preparation is narrower than
the full collection of CPU strategies or direct GPU mechanism masks.

| Family | Prepared support | Boundaries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Condensation | `MassCondensation` with isothermal or latent-heat strategy | Native discrete or resolved populations; explicit species maps; supported ideal/Kappa activity and constant/Water Buck vapor-pressure models; four fixed equal GPU substeps. |
| Coagulation | `Coagulation` with Brownian or an existing charged strategy | Particle-resolved, equal positive active counts, default interpolation controls. Charged fits replace Brownian rather than add to it. |
| Dilution | `Dilution` with exact exponential strategy | Counts/densities and gas inventory decrease consistently; no volume change. |
| Wall loss | `WallLoss` with spherical, rectangular or charged strategy | Particle-resolved; supported neutral/charged configuration is frozen at preparation; retired resolved slots retain the native raw-count semantics. |
| Nucleation | `Nucleation` with activation or kinetic strategy | Resolved unit-count, neutral injection with explicit species mapping, integral event demand and fixed capacity; supported exhaustion/resampling policy is retained. |
| Ion source | `IonPairSource` with constant production | Paired Poisson unit-count injection into fixed capacity; independent source RNG and inventory ledger. |
| Ion cleanup | `IonNeutralCleanup` | Exports neutral ion-only products from reserved material lanes; retains neutralized aerosol particles and records exported mass. |
| Ion condensation exclusion | `IonCondensationExclusion` | Companion configuration gating ion-only vapor proposals before inventory limiting in every substep. |
| Seed cohort | `SeedCohort` | Original unit-count seed lineages; first passage before background capture; observes after every physical process. |

Prepared charged coagulation accepts `HardSphereKernelStrategy`,
`CoulombDyachkov2007KernelStrategy`, `CoulombGatti2008KernelStrategy`,
`CoulombGopalakrishnan2012KernelStrategy`, and `CoulumbChahl2019KernelStrategy`
inside `ChargedCoagulationStrategy`. The selected fit is frozen and included in
checkpoint compatibility. Each uses the shared stochastic sampler and bounded
parallel pair maximum reduction. Capture and resume use the same model.
Custom subclasses and unsupported interpolation controls reject before upload.
See the [charged model comparison](../../examples/gpu/prepared/gpu_charged_models.py).
The [charged coagulation validation record](../../contribute/validation/gpu/charged-coagulation.md)
lists actual CUDA checks and remaining scientific boundaries.
For explicit atmospheric ions, use the separate
[atmospheric collision configuration](#atmospheric-ion-collisions) below.

Condensation retains configured transport coefficients and uses the mapped vapor
material's molar mass for transport mean free paths, matching native CPU physics.
It requires compatible
material/surface density, surface-tension model and molar masses. Ideal mass or
volume activity has narrower single-material/inactive support. Unsupported
custom classes, PDF populations, staggered/adaptive stepping, multiple volatile
material mappings or unsupported thermodynamics reject explicitly. See the
[direct condensation configuration](direct/condensation-configuration.md) for
underlying physics and the executable preparation error for a rejected plan.
Latent energy is diagnostic bookkeeping, not automatic temperature feedback.
For the supported single-phase volume-weighted surface model, each particle
uses its own composition. CPU surface mixing and Kelvin terms preserve that
particle axis as well; independent rows are never averaged into one mixture.

Process configuration, timestep, box layout and buffer capacity are frozen.
Editing the original Python strategy after preparation does not change a running
simulation. Changing these requires a new preparation; a checkpoint resume also
requires matching configuration and the exact supported device.

## Atmospheric ion collisions

`AtmosphericCoagulation` from `particula.dynamics.ions.coagulation` selects
one collision law per pair within the existing prepared sampler:

- aerosol–aerosol: the selected `charged_model`;
- free ion–aerosol: the conductive-air LF2013 attachment coefficients;
- opposite free ions: a constant recombination coefficient, default
  `1.7e-12 m³/s`;
- same-sign free ions and neutral ion-only products: zero collision rate.

This is one coagulation process, so do not compose a second `Coagulation` with
it. Supply distinct `positive_species` and `negative_species` material lanes.
Active particles must have unit represented counts. Positive ions have mass
150 u and charge +1; negative ions have mass 90 u and charge −1. The module
exports `POSITIVE_ION_MASS` and `NEGATIVE_ION_MASS` in kg for source setup.
Choose physical material densities to obtain the intended free-ion diameter;
these densities continue to determine volume after attachment.

LF2013 is restricted to 298.15 K and 101325 Pa, integer aerosol charge between
−100 and +100, and the published radius interval for each charge and polarity.
The global radius domain is 0.2 nm–10 µm. State and needed attachment rates are
validated on the device before collision sampling; invalid states or unsupported
fits fault at observation without advancing the collision RNG or applying merges.
A prior process in the same ordered step may already have completed.

The default `omitted="reject"` rejects repulsive rates below the table's fitted
radius interval. `omitted="lower"` assigns zero and `omitted="upper"` assigns
the published omission cutoff, `1e-15 m³/s`, only in those omitted repulsive
regions. These are explicit sensitivity bounds, not an extrapolation. Report
both when using this uncertainty treatment. Other unsupported inputs still
reject. Fits are evaluated only for polarities currently present in a box.

Ion source, cleanup and condensation-exclusion material maps must agree.
Sources must use the reference ion masses. Condensation requires the explicit
`IonCondensationExclusion` companion. Recombination products conserve their
material masses until cleanup exports them; neutralized aerosols remain active.
The collision law supports CUDA capture and checkpoint continuation. Derived
classifications and rates are rebuilt from physical state each step.

The [validation record](../../contribute/validation/gpu/charged-coagulation.md)
distinguishes pair-law, conservation and finite-population decay evidence from
the remaining atmospheric survival study. The coefficients follow
[López-Yglesias and Flagan (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/02786826.2013.783684).

## Paired ion production

`IonPairSource` from `particula.dynamics.ions.source` is an explicit,
prepared-only particle source. It composes with runnables using `|`. Supply
`production_rate` in ion pairs m^-3 s^-1, distinct positive/negative material
indices, and each ion's mass in kg. It samples a Poisson number of pairs per
box per step, with mean `production_rate * volume * time_step`. Each event
inserts both polarities with unit count and charges +1 and -1.

The source owns a separate random stream keyed by the root seed and logical
box identity. It participates in native CUDA capture and exact checkpoint
continuation. `simulation.ion_source_diagnostics()` returns detached cumulative
`injected_pairs` and extensive `injected_mass` [kg, box by particle species].
Include these external inputs in conservation checks.

Free slots must accommodate both members of every sampled pair. Insufficient
capacity faults the simulation at observation; no partial pair, resampling or
volume scaling occurs. The Poisson mean is bounded at one million pairs per
box per step and uses Warp's float32 Poisson parameter. Ordinary particle
state and inventories remain fp64. Zero production advances no source RNG.
CPU `execute()` is unsupported and rejects explicitly.

This source supplies particles, not atmospheric ion collision physics. Do not
interpret ordinary charged coagulation of these particles as validated
ion–aerosol attachment or ion–ion recombination.

Compose `IonCondensationExclusion` from `particula.dynamics.ions.condensation`
with `MassCondensation` to keep free ions and neutral ion-only products out of
vapor transfer. Specify the reserved positive/negative material indices; they
must match any ion source/cleanup configuration and must not be condensation
targets. Particles containing any other material remain eligible, including
aerosols carrying attached ions. Uptake and evaporation proposals are zeroed
for ion-only particles before gas inventory limiting in each substep. Physical
particle counts, masses and charges are never temporarily masked.

This configuration is frozen at preparation and preserved by capture/restart.
The native minimum-radius setting is a transport floor, not an exclusion rule.
Prepared condensation supports different physical material densities with a
constant surface-model density for Kelvin curvature. Physical particle volume
still sums mass divided by each material's density. Nonuniform surface-model
densities remain unsupported. This distinction allows equal-diameter ions of
different molecular masses without changing their physical material densities.

`IonNeutralCleanup` from `particula.dynamics.ions.cleanup` removes neutral
products containing both reserved ion materials and no other material.
Supply the same positive/negative material indices as the source. These lanes
must be reserved for ions; material composition is the classification contract.
Neutral aerosol particles with any mass in another lane are retained. Cleanup
does not itself model a recombination reaction or remove charged free ions.

Place cleanup at the chosen point in the ordered composition; it executes once
per prepared step and reclaims slots by zeroing all particle fields.
`simulation.ion_cleanup_diagnostics()` observes detached cumulative
`exported_particles` and `exported_mass` [kg, box by species]. Exported charge
is exactly zero. Check each species' initial mass plus injected mass against
remaining mass plus exported mass. The ledgers participate in CUDA capture and
exact checkpoint continuation. Unit active counts are required throughout;
evolving fractional counts fault before a box is modified.

## Original seed lineages

`SeedCohort` from `particula.execution.cohort` adds an observer to a prepared
composition. Supply distinct `seed_species` and `background_species` indices
and `target_diameter` [m, default 50 nm]. At preparation, each active particle
containing seed material contributes one original lineage; particles containing
background material receive a persistent background label. Labels describe the
initial population, not a later test of material composition.

The observer runs after every physical process, regardless of where its
configuration appears in the composition. It follows successfully applied
coagulation pairs, adds unresolved lineage counts on seed–seed mergers, and
clears donor labels before slot reuse. Any background merger captures unresolved
lineages before the merged particle's diameter is tested. A lineage that already
reached the threshold remains successful after later mergers. Diameter uses the
sum of material volumes, consistent with the native spherical-particle model.

`simulation.cohort_diagnostics()` returns detached per-box arrays `initial`,
`reached`, `captured` and `unresolved`. The invariant is
`initial = reached + captured + unresolved`. At the chosen end time, unresolved
lineages are right-censored. These counts differ from surviving particle counts:
two seeds may become one particle while retaining two unresolved lineages.
The labels and outcome ledger survive native capture and exact checkpoint
continuation; they never modify physical mass, charge or the collision RNG.

Supported physical companions are condensation, coagulation, ion sources and
ion cleanup. Ion material lanes must be distinct from both cohort markers.
Removal, dilution and resampling processes reject because their lineage-outcome
semantics are not defined here. All active counts must remain one.
First passage is resolved at process boundaries, not interpolated within a
condensation substep or physical time interval. A survival study must test
timestep and process-order sensitivity before interpreting rare-event results.

## State, forcing and observations

`run(steps)` enqueues fixed-duration steps. `completed_steps` and
`simulated_time` track enqueued work; synchronize or observe to establish device
success. Ordinary prepared steps perform no simulation-state download or device
array allocation. Explicit observation and forcing boundaries wait for pending
work and check status.

| Operation | Result and cost |
| --- | --- |
| `synchronize()` | Waits for this owner's stream and checks device failure status. |
| `diagnostics()` | Downloads box/species reductions: number, charge and mass concentration, active slots, thermodynamics and optional last-step latent energy. Does not download every particle. |
| `snapshot()` | Downloads detached native CPU particle, gas and environment arrays, retaining gas names, physical volumes and population measure. |
| `update_environment(...)` | Replaces positive temperature [K] and pressure [Pa], accepting scalars or per-box vectors. Without condensation, saturation can be prescribed explicitly. |
| `update_gas(concentration)` | Replaces the full ordered gas vector or box-by-gas matrix [kg/m³], in `gas_names` order. |
| `checkpoint()` | Saves immutable continuation bytes, RNG streams, counters, auxiliary state and frozen process configuration. Also provides detached inspection state. |
| `close()` | Drains outstanding work and releases resources; does not download a final snapshot. Context managers call it automatically. |

With condensation, saturation is derived from current gas and temperature using
the configured vapor-pressure law. Prescribing it separately rejects. Forcing
updates change values in place and refresh derived thermodynamics. They do not
change the immutable plan. Gas replacement is an external source or sink: record
its actual inventory change when checking conservation. Volume remains owned by
`ParticleData`, not the environment.

Snapshots are independent analysis objects. Editing one cannot change the GPU,
the initial CPU aerosol or another snapshot. A snapshot alone does not preserve
random-stream continuation. Checkpoints do; their canonical bytes, rather than
editable inspection arrays, govern restart. Checkpoints are currently in-memory
records, not a promised portable on-disk format. External forcing schedules and
their current position remain caller-owned.

## Capture and random streams

`capture()` records one timestep without advancing physics. Later `step()` and
`run()` replay the graph; `uncapture()` waits and restores ordinary prepared
execution. Capture requires native CUDA. The graph belongs to one live owner,
with fixed array identities, shapes, process order and timestep. Forcing may
update values between segments. Resume creates fresh buffers and requires a new
explicit capture. Warm up the first replay when timing: Warp may instantiate
the executable then.

For stable random-stream identities, supply a root seed and unique string
`logical_box_ids`, for example `("chamber-a", "chamber-b")`. Logical box identity
and process namespace determine streams, independently of physical box order.
Checkpoints preserve stream words and counters. Exact continuation is qualified
on the same device/runtime; cross-device bitwise reproducibility is not promised.

## Evolving compatibility and failure

Brownian coagulation requires equal active represented counts at every step.
For example, dilution can reduce existing counts while a later unit-count source
creates unequal cohorts. Such a sequence can become incompatible even though its
initial state was valid. A device guard stops coagulation before consuming its
RNG, and observation reports the failure. The cyclic chamber example omits
weight-changing sinks so repeated unit-count injection remains compatible.

Device failures stop dependent writers and fault the owner when observed.
Previously completed writes are not rolled back. Use a prior checkpoint to
restart a failed experiment; do not treat a faulted owner as reusable state.
Nucleation capacity and integral-demand failures likewise remain explicit.

## Choosing a useful workload

Small jobs can be dominated by preparation, transfers and graph setup. Keep
several steps resident and request reduced diagnostics when full distributions
are unnecessary. The Brownian majorant uses bounded temporary storage, but pair
work remains quadratic in particles per box. Large aggregate populations spread
across many independent boxes can therefore be more practical than one very
large coagulating box. Condensation and dilution have different scaling.

The [GPU examples](../../examples/gpu/index.md) show heterogeneous boxes,
time-varying forcing, stochastic ensembles, repeated source pulses and a
million-particle lifecycle. Their saved CUDA figures are deliberately refreshed;
site builds do not run these experiments.

## Runtime basis

This implementation is qualified with Warp 1.11.1. Warp arrays live on a chosen
device, kernel inputs must share that device, and CUDA graphs replay recorded
operations. Those constraints motivate explicit upload, stable owned buffers
and a graph tied to one simulation. See the matching
[Warp runtime documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/v1.11/user_guide/runtime.html).
Our API's process support and exact continuation guarantees are established by
Particula tests, rather than inferred from Warp's broader API.

GPU launches are asynchronous, so timing only Python dispatch misses device
work. The campaign waits for the measured work before stopping its timer and
reports separate preparation and transfer costs. Nsight Systems supplies
kernel-level attribution; profiling runs are separate from timing repetitions.
See [Warp profiling guidance](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/v1.11/deep_dive/profiling.html).
