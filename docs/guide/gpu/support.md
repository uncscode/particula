# GPU support

Use [prepared simulations](prepared.md) for the native CPU aerosol → resident
CUDA computation → CPU analysis workflow. Direct kernels and the concrete
resident interfaces remain available for callers who need explicit resource
control. Warp is a declared package dependency. CUDA availability is a separate
hardware/runtime requirement; requesting CUDA never selects Warp CPU silently.

| Area | Support | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native CPU storage | Multi-box particle, gas and environment containers | Explicit leading box axis and population metadata. |
| Native CPU dynamics | Five batched runnables through the shared box loop | Direct strategy methods remain single-box. |
| Prepared runnables | Ordered subsets of condensation, Brownian/charged coagulation, dilution, wall loss, nucleation, ion-pair production and neutral ion-product cleanup | One occurrence per family; exact supported configuration, fixed capacity and timestep. |
| CPU → CUDA | `runnable.prepare(aerosol, device="cuda:0", time_step=...)` | Validates, uploads once, owns private resources; initial CPU state is unchanged. |
| CUDA → CPU | `simulation.snapshot()` or reduced `diagnostics()` | Explicit synchronized, detached observations; full snapshots preserve native names and measures. |
| Forcing | Environment and full-gas updates between segments | Explicit uploads; condensation owns derived saturation. |
| Continuation | `checkpoint()` and matching runnable `resume()` | Exact device/configuration and canonical bytes; no automatic CPU fallback. |
| Native CUDA capture | `capture()`, then ordinary `step/run` | Non-advancing capture; fixed bindings; fresh capture after resume. |
| Direct kernels | Supported process-specific fixed-shape interfaces | Caller owns transfers, scratch, species bindings and RNG sidecars. |
| Warp CPU | Separate regression target | CPU evidence is labeled separately from actual CUDA execution and performance. |

Prepared Brownian and charged coagulation are particle-resolved and require
equal active counts. Prepared nucleation injects neutral unit-count events with integral
demand and explicit capacity policies. Their evolving compatibility matters;
see [failure boundaries](prepared.md#evolving-compatibility-and-failure).
Prepared condensation supports a bounded set of thermodynamic configurations and
four equal fixed substeps; it does not imply general CPU-strategy equivalence.

## Direct-kernel details

Direct coagulation supports singleton masks `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, pairs `3`, `5`,
`6`, `9`, `10`, `12`, and mask `15`. Three-way masks reject at their documented
preflight boundaries; turbulent masks require explicit turbulent inputs.
Sedimentation and turbulent mechanisms remain direct-only. Prepared charged
coagulation selects one of the five existing charged models.
See [configuration](direct/coagulation-configuration.md).

Direct collision outputs and persistent RNG are caller-owned, same-device
resources. Omitted optional sidecars may allocate call-local storage. Supplied
RNG advances in place; `initialize_rng=True` explicitly resets it. These are
execution resources, not new native container fields.

`ParticleData.volume` owns per-box physical volume. `EnvironmentData` owns CPU
temperature, pressure and saturation. Device vapor pressure is derived helper
state and has no native CPU `GasData` field. Direct restore therefore needs
externally retained gas names and drops vapor pressure; prepared snapshots retain
the names automatically, while checkpoints preserve continuation helper state.

Direct validation may synchronize status flags or scans. Prepared steps retain
validated resources and defer observation to explicit boundaries. Neither path
adds hidden backend fallback, general adaptive stepping, dynamic storage resizing,
a new PDF algorithm, unequal-multiplicity coagulation or multi-GPU execution.
