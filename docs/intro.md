# The `particula` JupyterBook

This is the `particula` JupyterBook for tutorials and documentation.
It is a Jupyter "book" that is organized into chapters.
Each chapter is a Jupyter notebook that can be executed.
The notebooks are organized in a way that makes it easy to follow along.
You can read more about the JupyterBook project [here](https://jupyter.org/community/jupyterbook/).

## What is `particula`?

`particula` is a Python package for studying and researching atmospheric particles, also known as aerosol(s).
It is in early development at the moment; we have made a conscious decision to start this development, _from scratch_, all in the open with the goal of making it a useful tool for the community, with the help of the community.
As of now, we are a mix of scientists and engineers, both from academia and industry, broadly specializing in atmospheric sciences, software development, and/or the intersection thereof.
Some of the components of the package may have appeared elsewhere in scattered publications --- certainly in some of our own --- and we hope this package will be a centralized place for us to conduct our research but for others to use it however they wish. Our license is MIT and it is very permissive.  

## How can I learn more about the science?

We plan to properly document the science and the code in these Jupyter notebooks in this website [https://uncscode.github.io/particula](https://uncscode.github.io/particula).
We are particularly keen to explore a few distinct, but highly related, scientific areas: aerosol particle dynamics and chemistry, their effects on air quality and public health, and their importance in weather and climate systems.

## How can I contribute?

We are very open and we welcome contributions from anyone who wants to contribute to the project.
We have a short contributing document in the root of the repository, which you can read [here](https://github.com/uncscode/particula/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
We will be adding a longer and more detailed document on this website soon.
In general, you should feel free to open and issue or submit a pull request with anything you deem appropriate.
