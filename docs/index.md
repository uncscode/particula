### :simple-pypi: PyPI Installation
If your Python environment is already set up, install Particula directly from PyPI:
```shell
pip install particula
```

### :simple-condaforge: Conda Installation

Alternatively, you can install Particula using conda:
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge particula
```

If you are new to Python or plan on going through the Examples, head to [Setup Particula](Examples/Setup_Particula/index.md) for more comprehensive installation instructions.

### Quick Start Example

Below is a minimal script demonstrating how to build an aerosol and run a single condensation step. Save it as `quick_start.py` and execute with `python quick_start.py`.

```python
import numpy as np
import particula as par

water = par.gas.GasSpecies(
    name="H2O",
    molar_mass=18.015e-3,
    vapor_pressure_strategy=par.gas.ConstantVaporPressureStrategy(2330),
    partitioning=True,
    concentration=1e-4,
)

atm = par.gas.Atmosphere(
    temperature=298.15,
    total_pressure=101325,
    partitioning_species=water,
)

particle = (
    par.particles.PresetParticleRadiusBuilder()
    .set_mode(np.array([100e-9]), "m")
    .set_geometric_standard_deviation(np.array([1.2]))
    .set_number_concentration(np.array([1e8]), "1/m^3")
    .set_density(1e3, "kg/m^3")
    .build()
)

aerosol = par.Aerosol(atmosphere=atm, particles=particle)
process = par.dynamics.MassCondensation(par.dynamics.CondensationIsothermal(0.018))
print(process.execute(aerosol, 10.0))
```
