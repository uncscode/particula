# Data in Particula

Within Particula, instrument data loading and processing is handled by the
`particula.data` module. This module contains a number of classes and
functions that can be used to load and process data from a variety of
sources. The `particula.data` module is designed to be used in conjunction
with the `particula.model` module, which can improve the interpretation of
the data.
