# GPU examples

These percent-cell Python scripts publish saved figures from actual CUDA runs.
Start with a native CPU aerosol, prepare supported processes on the GPU, and
bring detached results back for analysis. Install Particula and its plotting
extras, then read the [prepared workflow guide](../../guide/gpu/prepared.md).
Warp is a declared package dependency; CUDA also needs an available NVIDIA GPU
and compatible driver.
There is no CPU fallback in publication runs.

## Prepared simulations

| Example | Scientific or workflow question |
| --- | --- |
| [CPU → CUDA → CPU quick start](prepared/gpu_prepared_quick_start.py) | How do eight aerosol boxes evolve, change forcing, capture and resume? |
| [Charged Brownian models](prepared/gpu_charged_models.py) | How do five charged fits compare on CUDA against their CPU implementations? |
| [Heterogeneous boxes](prepared/gpu_prepared_multibox.py) | How do 64 boxes with different thermodynamic conditions, volume and composition respond? |
| [Cooling, heating and vapor forcing](prepared/gpu_prepared_forcing.py) | How does a four-material/five-gas population respond to an external schedule? |
| [Stochastic coagulation ensemble](prepared/gpu_prepared_stochastic.py) | How much does evolution vary across sixteen random seeds? |
| [Million-particle lifecycle](prepared/gpu_prepared_lifecycle.py) | Can 1,572,864 active particles use all five processes with exact capture/restart agreement? |
| [Repeated source pulses](prepared/gpu_prepared_cyclic_chamber.py) | How do new cohorts, Brownian collisions and cyclic condensation interact over 600 seconds? |

The heterogeneous example varies several conditions together and does not
identify a temperature-only effect. Ensemble shading is a distribution across
seeds, not a confidence interval. Large counts establish execution and accounting;
physical predictions still require appropriate model choice and convergence.

The [RTX 5060 scaling report](prepared/gpu_scaling_results.py) separates
resident throughput, complete-workflow costs, old/new Brownian GPU execution
and memory. Its small downloadable data contains plotted summaries and displayed provenance,
not model states or image arrays.

## Direct kernels and concrete resident interfaces

| Example | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [Direct quick start](direct/gpu_direct_kernels_quick_start.py) | Manual transfers and a first condensation step. |
| [Direct Brownian coagulation](direct/gpu_coagulation_direct.py) | Size distribution and conserved mass after a direct call. |
| [Complete direct sequence](direct/gpu_complete_process_sequence.py) | Five explicit boundaries; the nucleation call has zero duration. |
| [Condensation parity](direct/gpu_condensation_parity_walkthrough.py) | Fixed-four-substep numerical oracle, transfer and energy diagnostics. |
| [Direct nucleation](direct/gpu_direct_nucleation.py) | Unit-count events in boxes with different physical volumes. |
| [Resident checkpoint lifecycle](resident/gpu_resident_session.py) | State ownership and exact restart, without advancing physics. |
| [Resident multi-timestep loop](resident/gpu_resident_multi_timestep.py) | An open-system sequence with explicit forcing and sinks. |
| [Native graph capture](resident/gpu_resident_graph_capture.py) | Captured resident-loop execution and physical outputs. |

For the public introduction, run:

```bash
python docs/examples/gpu/prepared/gpu_prepared_quick_start.py
```

For the illustrated CUDA path in an older direct/resident source, pass `--cuda`:

```bash
python docs/examples/gpu/direct/gpu_direct_kernels_quick_start.py --cuda
```

Older sources retain portable unflagged regression helpers. Their Warp CPU or
no-Warp behavior is separate from published CUDA evidence. A clean optional skip
does not establish GPU correctness or speed.

## Deliberate result refresh

Site builds render saved results without executing simulations. Refresh a CUDA
example explicitly, then review and commit its complete result bundle:

```bash
python scripts/docs_examples.py refresh gpu-prepared-quick-start
python scripts/docs_examples.py refresh gpu-prepared-cyclic-chamber
```

Large scientific studies may take longer than ten minutes; their registry
entries allow up to two hours. CI checks source, dependency freshness and saved
file integrity without executing these CUDA studies. Download the helper ZIP
for examples that use shared study code, then run `example.py` from its extracted
folder. See [authoring guidance](../../../website/AUTHORING.md) and
[validation records](../../contribute/validation/index.md).
