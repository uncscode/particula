    "# Introduction to the Lagrangian Box Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop a simple box model for a Lagrangian particle. This model serves as a foundational tool to understand how various processes influence the evolution of a particle. We will start with a basic framework and gradually introduce more complex elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Particle Dynamics in a Cube\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we simulate particles moving within a cubic space. When these particles collide, they coagulate. This initial model does not include processes like condensation, evaporation, or forces such as drag. However, these elements will be integrated in subsequent steps to enhance realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhancing Particle Realism and Model Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the particles lack realistic properties, but we plan to incorporate these features progressively. The model's complexity will also be scaled up, which is where the flexibility of the `particula.lagrangian` module becomes crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leveraging PyTorch for Enhanced Computational Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is designed with a focus on PyTorch, allowing us to seamlessly switch between CPU and GPU computations. This capability becomes increasingly important as we add more particles and complexity to the model, necessitating the use of GPU for efficient computation.\n"

    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we have explored the dynamics of a Lagrangian particle system within a defined cubic space. Our focus has been on simulating and analyzing the interactions and evolution of particles under a set of initial conditions and physical laws. Here is a brief overview of what we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Definition and Initialization\n",
    "- We began by defining the simulation space and initial conditions for our particle system. This included setting parameters such as the number of particles, mass, and dimensions of the cubic space, as well as initializing the positions and velocities of the particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Process\n",
    "- The core of our simulation involved a series of iterative steps to simulate particle dynamics. These steps included checking boundary conditions, calculating distances, detecting and handling collisions, coalescing particles, applying forces, and integrating the equations of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Saving and Analysis\n",
    "- Throughout the simulation, we saved key data points, such as the position and mass of particles at specified intervals. This allowed us to track and analyze the changes in the system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization and Interpretation\n",
    "- We utilized various visualization techniques to interpret the simulation results. This included creating 3D plots to visualize the final positions of particles and histograms to analyze the distribution of mass at different stages of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights Gained\n",
    "- The simulation provided valuable insights into the behavior of particles in a Lagrangian framework. We observed how particles interact, coalesce, and evolve over time under the influence of set physical parameters and forces."
