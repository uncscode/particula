# Examples

Welcome to the Particula Examples Gallery! Here you’ll find a curated collection of notebooks and step‑by‑step tutorials designed to help you explore, learn, and extend the core functionality of Particula. Whether you’re looking for a full end‑to‑end simulation, a focused how‑to guide, or a deep dive into individual components, each card below links to a ready‑to‑run example with contextual explanations and code snippets.

Use the **End‑to‑End Simulations** to see complete workflows in action, then explore the **How‑To Guides** for targeted recipes that tackle specific processes (e.g., chamber wall losses, thermodynamic equilibria, or nucleation events). Finally, the **Tutorials** section breaks down the building blocks of Particula’s architecture—Aerosol objects, Dynamics modules, Gas Phase definitions, and Particle Phase representations—so you can customize and combine them in your own research.

Jump in by selecting any card below and follow along in your browser or local environment. Happy modeling!
