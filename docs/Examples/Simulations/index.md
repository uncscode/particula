# Simulations

This directory hosts end‑to‑end aerosol simulation notebooks built with Particula. Each notebook walks you through a complete modeling workflow—from setup to visualization or analysis.

## Available Simulations

- **[Biomass Burning Cloud Interactions](Notebooks/Biomass_Burning_Cloud_Interactions.ipynb)**  
  End‑to‑end biomass burning aerosol‑cloud simulation using Particula.

- **[Organic Partitioning and Coagulation](Notebooks/Organic_Partitioning_and_Coagulation.ipynb)**
  End‑to‑end organic aerosol partitioning and coagulation simulation using Particula.

- **[Cough Droplets Partitioning](Notebooks/Cough_Droplets_Partitioning.ipynb)**  
  Simulates the evaporation of cough droplets in a well-mixed air environment, tracking size distribution and composition changes over time.

- **[Soot Formation in Flames](Notebooks/Soot_Formation_in_Flames.ipynb)**  
  Simulates soot formation in a cooling combustion plume, tracking particle growth and chemical speciation.

- **[Cloud Chamber Single Cycle](Notebooks/Cloud_Chamber_Single_Cycle.ipynb)**  
  Single activation–deactivation cycle with kappa-based activity, wall loss, growth/shrink visualization, and mass conservation checks.

- **[Cloud Chamber Multi Cycle](Notebooks/Cloud_Chamber_Multi_Cycle.ipynb)**  
  Four-cycle comparison across ammonium sulfate, sucrose, and mixed seeds with kappa-dependent activation, wall-loss analysis, and gallery overlays.
