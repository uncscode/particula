# Using pip (PyPI Installation)

Particula is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip. Ensure you have an active virtual environment (e.g., created with `python -m venv` or `conda`) and then run:

```bash
pip install particula
```

This will download and install Particula and its dependencies from the Python Package Index. For detailed guidance on setting up a virtual environment and using pip, see the [pip installation guide](pip.md).
