    "# Vapor Pressure Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase. It is a crucial measure for understanding the tendency of molecules to transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This property is particularly important in systems where an aerosol (gas phase + particle phase) is in equilibrium with both phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vapor pressure varies with temperature, and this variation can manifest in several forms. Understanding these changes is key to predicting how substances will behave under different temperature conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the strategies for calculating vapor pressure as implemented in the `vapor_pressure` module. These strategies are essential for accurately modeling and understanding the behavior of aerosols in equilibrium with a liquid phase.\n",

    "## Strategies for Vapor Pressure Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "In our framework, all strategies for calculating vapor pressure are encapsulated within classes that inherit from the `VaporPressureStrategy` abstract base class. This design ensures that each strategy conforms to a standardized interface, making them interchangeable and simplifying integration with other components of our modular framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functions\n",
    "We define two primary functions that form the backbone of our vapor pressure calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculate_partial_pressure`: This function computes the partial pressure of a gas given its concentration, molar mass, and temperature. It applies the ideal gas law to derive the partial pressure in Pascals (Pa).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculate_concentration`: This function inversely calculates the concentration of a gas from its partial pressure, molar mass, and temperature, also using the ideal gas law.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can be reused for different strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Base Class\n",
    "The `VaporPressureStrategy` class serves as an abstract base class that outlines the necessary methods for vapor pressure calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `partial_pressure`: Calculates the partial pressure of a gas based on its concentration, molar mass, and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `concentration`: Calculates the concentration of a gas based on its partial pressure, temperature, and molar mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `saturation_ratio`: Computes the ratio of the current vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure, which indicates how \"saturated\" the gas is with respect to a given temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `saturation_concentration`: Determines the maximum concentration of a gas at saturation at a given temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pure_vapor_pressure`: This abstract method must be implemented by each subclass to calculate the pure (saturation) vapor pressure of a gas at specific temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring our vapor pressure strategies around this abstract base class, we maintain high flexibility and robustness in our approach. Each subclass can implement specific behaviors for different gases or conditions, while relying on a common set of tools and interfaces provided by the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Antoine Equation Vapor Pressure Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The Antoine equation is a widely used empirical formula for estimating the vapor pressure of a substance over a range of temperatures. It takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log_{10}(P) = A - \\frac{B}{T - C}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P$ is the vapor pressure in mmHg,\n",
    "- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin,\n",
    "- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are substance-specific constants.\n",
    "  - These constants are typically determined experimentally and can vary for different substances.\n",
    "  - The Antoine equation is often used for organic compounds and provides a good approximation of vapor pressure behavior, over a limited temperature range.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement this for the following substances, using constants from [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118135341.app1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- n-Butanol: \"Formula\": \"C4H10O\", \"A\": 7.838, \"B\": 1558.190, \"C\": 196.881\n",
    "\n",
    "- Styrene: \"Formula\": \"C8H8\", \"A\": 6.92409, \"B\": 1420, \"C\": 226\n",
    "\n",
    "- Water: \"Formula\": \"H2O\", \"A\": 7.94917, \"B\": 1657.462, \"C\": 227.02\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direct Strategy, Builder, and Factory Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate the use of the direct, builder, and factory patterns to create instances of the `AntoineVaporPressure` strategy. These patterns provide different levels of abstraction and flexibility in object creation, catering to various use cases and design requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Strategy**: This involves directly creating instances of the `AntoineVaporPressure` class with the required parameters. It is straightforward but may be less flexible when dealing with complex object creation or configuration.\n",
    "- **Builder Pattern**: The builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for more flexible and readable object creation. We will use a `VaporPressureBuilder` class to construct instances of the `AntoineVaporPressure` strategy with different parameters. The parameters can be set in any order, and the builder provides a clear and intuitive way to create objects.\n",
    "- **Factory Pattern**: The factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. We will use a `VaporPressureFactory` class to create instances of the `AntoineVaporPressure` strategy based on the substance name. This pattern allows for dynamic object creation based on input parameters, enhancing flexibility and extensibility."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we covered how the strategies for vapor pressure calculations are implemented in our system. By using an abstract base class and common core functions, we ensure that each strategy adheres to a standardized interface and can be easily integrated into our framework. We explored the Antoine equation vapor pressure strategy for n-Butanol, Styrene, and Water, examining how their vapor pressures and saturation concentrations change with temperature. We calculated the partial pressure, saturation ratio, and saturation concentration for these substances, providing insights into their behavior in gas-phase systems. Finally, we demonstrated the consistency and flexibility of our approach by applying different vapor pressure strategies to calculate the vapor pressure of water and observing how the values vary with temperature.\n",

    "This modular and extensible design allows us to incorporate various vapor pressure calculation methods while maintaining a consistent interface and ensuring robustness and flexibility in our system."
