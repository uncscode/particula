    "## Iterating Over Gas Species\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `Gas` object has been established, it enables us to iterate over each `GasSpecies` within the mixture. This functionality is particularly valuable for evaluating and adjusting properties dynamically, such as when changes in temperature and pressure occur due to environmental alterations.\n",

    "### Practical Example: Altitude Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where our gas mixture is transported from sea level to an altitude of 10 kilometers. Such a change in altitude significantly impacts both temperature and pressure, which in turn affects the behavior of each gas species in the mixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geopotential Height Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure and temperature changes with altitude can be approximated by using the geopotential height equation. Here's how you can calculate these changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pressure Change**: The pressure at a given altitude can be estimated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   P = P_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{L \\cdot h}{T_0}\\right)^{\\frac{g \\cdot M}{R \\cdot L}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $ P $ is the pressure at altitude $ h $,\n",
    "   - $ P_0 $ is the reference pressure at sea level (101325 Pa),\n",
    "   - $ L $ is the standard temperature lapse rate (approximately 0.0065 K/m),\n",
    "   - $ h $ is the altitude in meters (10000 m for 10 km),\n",
    "   - $ T_0 $ is the reference temperature at sea level (288.15 K),\n",
    "   - $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.80665 m/s²),\n",
    "   - $ M $ is the molar mass of Earth's air (0.0289644 kg/mol),\n",
    "   - $ R $ is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature Change**: The temperature decreases linearly with altitude at the lapse rate $ L $:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   T = T_0 - L h\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using this formula, we can estimate the temperature at an altitude of 10 km:\n",
    "   - $T$ = 223.15 K\n",
    "   - $L$ = 0.0065 K/m\n",
    "   - $h$ = 10000 m\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "By iterating through each `GasSpecies`, we can apply these formulas to adjust their properties based on the calculated pressure and temperature at 10 km altitude, aiding in simulations or real-world applications where altitude plays a crucial role in gas behavior.\n"
