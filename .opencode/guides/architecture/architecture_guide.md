# Architecture Guide

## GPU Module Boundaries

The GPU package keeps a strict separation between transfer, schema, and
kernel-entry responsibilities.

### Transfer boundary

- `particula/gpu/conversion.py` owns explicit CPU↔GPU transfer helpers only.
- It should not absorb launch-time kernel validation or normalization logic.

### Schema boundary

- `particula/gpu/warp_types.py` defines Warp-backed container schemas only.
- It should remain a passive data-shape layer rather than a behavior layer.

### Kernel normalization boundary

- `particula/gpu/kernels/environment.py` owns shared private normalization and
  validation for GPU kernel entry points.
- This module is the common boundary for accepting legacy scalars, direct
  `(n_boxes,)` Warp arrays, or `WarpEnvironmentData` inputs before launch-time
  work.
- Condensation and coagulation should reuse this boundary rather than
  re-implementing environment validation independently.

### GPU package export boundary

- `particula.gpu` remains the public home for Warp availability, context, and
  explicit CPU↔GPU transfer helpers.
- Direct GPU step entry points should be imported from
  `particula.gpu.kernels`, not re-exported from top-level `particula.gpu`.
- Lower-level kernel helpers should stay module-local to
  `particula.gpu.kernels.condensation` and
  `particula.gpu.kernels.coagulation` unless a broader public contract is
  intentionally documented.
- `particula.gpu.kernels.dilution` is an intentionally concrete-module-only
  P1 input boundary and is not re-exported through `particula.gpu.kernels`.
  Its current contract validates dilution inputs and returns identical state
  without a kernel launch or mutation; P2 owns executable dilution and any
  export decision, while P3 owns complete state and per-box value preflight.

## Design Intent

- Keep CPU↔GPU transfers explicit.
- Keep Warp container definitions stable and behavior-free.
- Keep cross-entry-point normalization private to `particula/gpu/kernels/`.
- Share validation at kernel boundaries when multiple GPU entry points consume
  the same environment contract.
- Keep GPU exports deliberate: top-level helpers in `particula.gpu`, direct
  step entry points in `particula.gpu.kernels`.
