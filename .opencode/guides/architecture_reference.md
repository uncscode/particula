This reference summarizes the particula package structure and key architectural
conventions migrated from the legacy guide set.

## Architectural Patterns

- Keep physics calculations in focused modules with clear units and citations.
- Use strategy, builder, and factory patterns where the package already uses
  them, especially in wall loss, vapor pressure, and representation code.
- Keep tests co-located with modules in `tests/` directories.
- Export public APIs deliberately through package `__init__.py` files.
- Keep validation close to public function boundaries.

## Wall Loss

Wall loss strategies live in `particula.dynamics.wall_loss` and are exported
through `particula.dynamics`.

Key concepts:

- `WallLossStrategy` is the abstract base class.
- `WallLoss` wraps a strategy, splits `time_step` across `sub_steps`, clamps
  concentrations nonnegative, and composes with other runnables via `|`.
- `ChargedWallLossStrategy` adds image-charge enhancement, optional electric
  field drift, and neutral fallback when particle charge and field are zero.
- Supported distribution types are `"discrete"`, `"continuous_pdf"`, and
  `"particle_resolved"`.

## Scientific Utilities

- Physical constants belong in `particula.util.constants`.
- Public numerical validation uses `particula.util.validate_inputs`.
- Chemical helper code lives under `particula/util/chemical/`.

## Documentation

Architecture guides and ADRs are under `.opencode/guides/architecture/`. Update
them when module boundaries, exported APIs, or major design patterns change.
