    "# Chamber Forward Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehending particle dynamics within controlled environments is fundamental for the precise interpretation of experimental measurements. An aerosol chamber forward simulation is an approach employed to analyze and predict the behavior of particles under laboratory conditions. This method enables us to construct a virtual representation of the chamber dynamics, providing a platform to systematically examine the influence of different physical and chemical processes on aerosol populations. Specifically, we focus on three key processes: chamber aerosol dilution, particle coagulation, and wall loss (deposition). Each of these plays a pivotal role in shaping the size distribution of particles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chamber Aerosol Dilution**: Dilution refers to the reduction in particle concentration due to the introduction of clean air into the chamber. This process can lead to a decrease in the overall number of particles without altering the size distribution significantly. However, it can indirectly influence the dynamics of coagulation and deposition by changing the particle concentration.\n",
    "- **Particle Coagulation**: Coagulation is the process where particles collide and stick together, forming larger particles. This leads to a shift in the size distribution towards larger sizes, reducing the number of smaller particles and increasing the average size of particles in the chamber. Coagulation is particularly significant for smaller particles due to their higher Brownian motion and likelihood of interaction.\n",
    "- **Wall Loss** (Deposition): Wall loss occurs when particles deposit onto the walls of the chamber, removing them from the airborne population. This process preferentially affects larger particles due to their greater settling velocity and can lead to a decrease in the overall number of particles and a subtle shift in the size distribution towards smaller sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be running a simulation of a chamber experiment, and turn on/off each of these processes to see how they affect the size distribution of particles. We'll also be able to see how the size distribution changes over time as the experiment progresses.\n",

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we conducted a series of simulations to study the behavior of aerosol particles within a controlled chamber environment. Our objective was to understand how different processes — namely coagulation, dilution, and wall loss — individually and collectively influence the size distribution of particles over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulations revealed several key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coagulation Alone**: When only coagulation was considered, the particle size distribution shifted towards larger particles as expected, since smaller particles tend to combine. However, this view was incomplete as it did not account for other loss mechanisms.\n",
    "- **Importance of Wall Loss**: The inclusion of wall loss in the simulations proved to be significant. Wall loss, or deposition, especially affected the larger particles due to their higher probability of contact with the chamber walls. This process led to a noticeable reduction in the number concentration of particles, altering the peak and width of the size distribution.\n",
    "- **Combined Processes**: By simulating a combination of processes, we observed a more complex and realistic representation of particle dynamics. The coagulation plus dilution scenario showed a lower overall concentration across all sizes, while adding wall loss further decreased the number concentration and altered the distribution shape, underscoring the importance of including wall loss in chamber simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between the different scenarios highlighted that coagulation alone could not fully explain the experimental observations. The absence of wall loss from the simulation would lead to discrepancies when comparing with empirical data, as wall loss is a critical process in chamber dynamics."
